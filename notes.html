        Tags
      </h3>
      <p>
        HTML uses <strong>tags</strong> as it's basic method of formatting.
        <br> Tags represent things involving formatting
        such as <strong>< br ></strong> which represents <br>page <br>breaks.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are alot of other tags. <strong>< img ></strong> is a tag that
        is used to direct the broswer to the source file
        of an image and place it in the browser window.
        <br>
        <br>
        Also, you can create a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"> link</a>
        using the <strong>< a ></strong> tag.
        <br>
        You simply type <strong>< a href="yourlinkhere"></strong> then the text you want as a link
        <br>
        <strong>< /a ></strong> then the closing bracket.
      </p>

      <h3>
        HTML Document Structure
      </h3>
      <p>
        HTML documents have two basic sections.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first is the <strong>< head ></strong> head section. The head
        section is the section that all of your first run stuff
        goes, such as Javascript and CSS code. Another thing
        you want to place in your head section is the <strong>< title ></strong> tag. The title
        tag is where your browser looks to populate the little bar
        at the top of the window when you're visiting a webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second main section is the <strong>< body ></strong> body section.
        <br>
        The body section is where you want to place all of your text, images,
        links, etc. It is where the real <strong><em> meat </em></strong> of your page goes.
      </p>
